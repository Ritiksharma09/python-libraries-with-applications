1. NumPy

    Purpose: Numerical computation.
    Application:
        Performs fast array operations
        Common in data manipulation and mathematical calculations.
        Supports multi-dimensional arrays and matrix operations.
    Example: Generating random data for simulations.

    python

    import numpy as np
    data = np.random.rand(10, 5)

    Application Area: Data analysis, scientific computation, machine learning.

3. Pandas

    Purpose: Data manipulation and analysis.
    Application:
        Works with structured data (dataframes).
        Data cleaning, manipulation, merging, and grouping.
    Example: Loading CSV data for analysis.

    python

    import pandas as pd
    df = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

    Application Area: Data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA).

4. Matplotlib

    Purpose: Data visualization.
    Application:
        Creates static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
        Plots like line charts, bar charts, scatter plots.
    Example: Basic line plot.

    python

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
    plt.show()

    Application Area: Visualizing trends in data, scientific visualizations.

5. Seaborn

    Purpose: Statistical data visualization.
    Application:
        Built on top of Matplotlib for creating attractive visualizations.
        Supports heatmaps, pair plots, violin plots, etc.
    Example: Plotting relationships in data.

    python

import seaborn as sns
sns.pairplot(data)

Application Area: Visualizing correlations, distribution of data.
